#Employee Performance Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes employee performance and promotion trends using **Python, Statistics, and Data Analysis techniques**.
The goal is to evaluate employee performance, understand salary distribution, and calculate the probability of promotion based on performance metrics.

## Dataset Information

**File Name:** `employee_performance.csv`
**Records:** ~4000 employees

### Dataset Columns:

* `Employee_ID` – Unique employee identifier
* `Department` – Department name
* `Age` – Employee age
* `Salary` – Monthly salary
* `Projects_Completed` – Number of projects completed
* `Working_Hours` – Average working hours
* `Performance_Score` – Performance score (0–100)
* `Promotion_Status` – Promotion result (Yes/No)

---

##  Project Objectives

* Analyze **central tendency and dispersion** of salary and projects
* Calculate **promotion probability**
* Apply **conditional probability**
* Study **data distribution and normality**
* Apply **linear algebra concepts** on employee work data
* Generate **HR insights** using data-driven methods

---

##  Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* SciPy

---

##  Project Tasks Covered

###  Part A – Theory

* Mean, Median, Mode
* Range vs Variance
* Normal vs Poisson Distribution
* Skewness explanation
* Conditional Probability
* Bayes’ Theorem
* PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

###  Part B – Practical

* Central tendency & dispersion calculations
* Probability & conditional probability of promotion
* Histogram with Gaussian curve
* Skewness & kurtosis analysis
* Q-Q plot for normality
* Linear algebra:

  * Dot product
  * Vector norms
  * Angle between vectors

---

## \ Key Insights

* Employees with **Performance_Score > 80** have higher promotion probability
* Salary distribution shows **skewness**, indicating pay inequality
* Project workload varies significantly across employees
* Linear algebra helps compare employee work intensity
* Promotion depends on performance but not performance alone

##  Output

* Console-based statistical results
* Graphical visualizations (Histogram, Q-Q Plot)
* Final insights printed in terminal

---

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **Python and statistical methods** can be effectively used for **employee performance evaluation and promotion analysis**, providing meaningful insights for HR decision-making.
